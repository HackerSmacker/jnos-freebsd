Significant work on RAW sockets to work with IPV6, require for all forms
of outgoing PING commands to work from both the CONSOLE and BBS prompt :

icmpcmd.c - all outgoing PING commands now work from both the JNOS console
  and the user BBS prompt, all options tested, they all seem to work.

socket.c - TYPE_RAW now supports IPV6 traffic, also because JNOS uses the
  linux TAP interface, I have to pullup the ethernet header before we can
  pullup the ipv6 header. I've modified both recv_mbuf() and send_mbuf(),
  although no point using send_mbuf(), ipv6_send() is more direct. Tested
  the use of send_mbuf() in the ping code anyways, and it works fine.

 ipv6.c - reincorporate the RAW IP processing (it was commented out), but
  it is most certainly required for any RAW socket processing ...

 ip.c - init new ipver field of the modified 'struct raw_ip' for IPV4, the
  only way for RAW IP processing code to know what version of IP is in use.

 ip.h - added new ipver field to 'struct raw_ip', added 2 prototoypes
   for IPV6 RAW socket functions

 icmpv6.c - reincororate echo_proc() in the form of new function echo6_proc()
  (and fixed a next_header typo, ICMP_TCL should be ICMPV6_PTCL)

 icmp.h - added IPV6 variables to 'struct ping'

 version.c - just to make sure people know it's a development version
