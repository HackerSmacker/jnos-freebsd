ipv6.h - added j2_ipv6_asc2ntwk(), ipv6shortform() prototypes.
ipv6misc.c - two new functions, j2_ipv6_asc2ntwk(), ipv6shortform().
netuser.c - new function pinetv6 (for JNOS logfile).
netuser.h - added pinetv6() prototype.
telnet.c - replaced bunch of code with new j2_ipv6_asc2ntwk() func.
forward.c - new '6' option to telnet forward to IPV6 hosts.
   (uses the new j2_ipv6_asc2ntwk() as well)
mboxgate.c - let BBS user telnet to ipv6 hosts.
 (could be cleaner)
tcpcmd.c - 'tcp status' now shows ipv6 socket info.
mboxcmd.c - 'mbox' user ipv6 addresses now in short form.
  (not perfect, needs more work, but definitely shorter length)
ipv6route.c - commented out excessive debug log() calls, finally
 using new icmpv6_output() so I can send ICMPV6_DEST_UNREACHABLE
   or ICMPV6_TIME_EXCEED messages back to sender. (needs work).
ipv6.c - commented out excessive debug log() calls.
icmpv6.c - finally wrote the icmpv6_output() function, commented
 out excessive debug log() calls, figured out checksum issues.
ipv6iface.c - commented out excessive debug log() calls.
ipv6hdr.c - commented out excessive debug log() calls.
main.c - log() should now show ipv6 socket information.
sockutil.c - added ipv6 support to the psocket() call.
icmpv6.h - added prototype for icmpv6_output() func.
makefile - added new ipv6misc.o object, changed configure vers
configure - changed version to match makefile
mboxmail.c - ipv6 address showing in 'mbox sid' was being truncated
 (but now, tcp port is included, which I didn't want, no harm, fix it later)
